# SHOPPER

First things first you'll need to have `npm` and `git` installed in your machine. To play the App you can use some Android/IOs emulator in your computer or simply install the Expo/Expo Go (AppStore or PlayStore). Follow the steps bellow to use the app:
```
git clone https://github.com/all123all/shopper.git
cd shopper
npm install
expo start
```
In the terminal you'll see a QRCode, open you Expo app in your smartphone and read the QRCode. The app will open automatically. You don't need to worry about `API_KEY`, i just left that on repository to make the app work easier, so you don't need to create an `API_KEY` by yourself.
